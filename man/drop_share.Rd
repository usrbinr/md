\usage{
drop_share(.con, share_name)
}
\arguments{
\item{.con}{A valid \code{DBI} connection (DuckDB / MotherDuck).}

\item{share_name}{Character. The name of the share to be dropped.}
}
\value{

\description{
Drops (deletes) a specified share from your MotherDuck account. If the share
does not exist, a warning is displayed. This function safely validates the
connection and share name before executing the operation.
}
\details{
The function first validates that the connection is active. It then checks
whether the specified share exists in the account. If it does, the share is
dropped using a \verb{DROP SHARE IF EXISTS} SQL command. If the share does not
exist, a warning is shown. After the operation, the current user is displayed.
